THE GAME OF BATTLE.</h2>
</div>


<p>The Game of Battle represents two antagonistic armies,
one of which, the Attacking (or Invading) Army,
is composed of four figures, each representing a regiment
of Light Infantry; five figures, each representing
a regiment of Infantry of the Line; two figures, each
representing a regiment of Cavalry; two figures, each
representing a battery of Artillery; and one figure (a
wagon), representing the &#8220;Supply Train,&#8221; in which it is
to be supposed is carried all of the subsistence, ordnance
stores, etc., necessary for the maintenance and effectiveness
of the army.</p>

<p>The object of the Attacking Army will be to capture
the Citadel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>The other army, called the Defending Army, is composed
of four figures, each representing a regiment of
Light Infantry; five figures, each representing a regiment
of Infantry of the Line; two figures, each representing
a regiment of Cavalry; two figures, each representing
a battery of Artillery; and one figure, the Citadel,
representing a city in which are arms, ammunition,
foundries, subsistence supplies, and all kinds of government
property, which it is of vital importance to hold.</p>

<p>The object, therefore, of the Defending Army will be
to secure the Citadel against capture.</p>

<p>Light Infantry moves one, two, or three squares, at
the discretion of the player, directly forward, right or

and can<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> take Light Infantry, Infantry of the
Line, Cavalry, and Artillery.</p>

<p>Infantry of the Line moves one or two squares in any

Light Infantry, Infantry of the Line, Cavalry, and Artillery.</p>

<p>Cavalry moves one, two, or three squares, at the discretion
of the player, in any direction, and takes Light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
Infantry, Infantry of the Line, Cavalry, and Artillery.</p>

<p>Artillery moves one, two, or three squares, at the
discretion of the player, diagonally, and can<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> take Artillery,
but cannot take Light Infantry, Infantry of the
Line, or Cavalry, though it can check them; that is,
neither of those figures can come within the range of
the Artillery, except when protected by Artillery of its
side; in which case Light Infantry, Infantry of the
Line, Cavalry, or Artillery, can move on the first square
next to the Artillery of their side; but Light Infantry,
Infantry of the Line, or Cavalry, cannot occupy the
second or third square; nor can either of the last-named
figures occupy the first square next to the Artillery
of their side, if it is also the first square next to the
Artillery of the other side. Artillery can be placed
there, but of course could be taken by the Artillery of
the other side. See Plate 2, Figure 1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>Artillery does not cover (or command) the second or
third square from it when a figure intervenes. See
Plate 2, Figure 2.</p>

<p>When a piece of artillery bears on a figure of the
other side that is not on the first square next to the Artillery
of its side, if Cavalry, Light Infantry, or Infantry
of the Line, it must move out of range of Artillery.
See Plate 2, Figure 3.</p>

<p>Artillery cannot be moved leaving a figure of Cavalry,
Light Infantry, or Infantry of the Line, of its side,
in range of Artillery of the opposite side. See Plate 2,
Figure 4.</p>

<p>Artillery cannot take the Citadel; but when placed
so as to command it, the defending party must bring
some figure to the defence, and take or drive off the
Artillery of the attacking party before moving otherwise.</p>

<p>Artillery cannot take the Wagon; but when a piece
of Artillery of the defending side is placed so as to bring
the Wagon within its range, if the attacking party cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
take that piece of Artillery, then the Wagon must
be moved out of its range.</p>

<p>The Wagon cannot occupy the second or third square
from its Artillery, if that square is in range of the Artillery
of the defending side; nor can it occupy the first
square next to the Artillery of its side, if it is also the
first square next to the Artillery of the defending side.</p>

<p>Should all of the figures of a side be taken except the
Artillery, that side loses the game, as Artillery cannot
take the Citadel or Wagon.</p>

<p>Light Infantry, Infantry of the Line, or Cavalry, can
take the Citadel or Wagon.</p>

<p>The capture of the Citadel or Wagon will decide the
game.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">REMARKS</h2>
</div>



<p class="center">ILLUSTRATING THE POWER OF THE FIGURES IN THE<br />
GAME, AS COMPARED WITH THAT OF TROOPS IN THE<br />
FIELD.</p>


<p>The inventor has endeavored to give to the figures of
his game a relative power which would, as nearly as
practicable, accord with that of the arms represented.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the Infantry of the Line
moves one or two squares in any direction, and can
take either Infantry, Cavalry, or Artillery; while the
Cavalry can move one, two, or three squares, in any
direction, and can take either Cavalry, Infantry, or Artillery.
We know that in a country comparatively
level, such as the board represents, and presenting no
obstacle except the river, Infantry or Cavalry can move
in any direction, and under some circumstances either
of those arms is good against the other. It is, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
course, necessary that there should be some distinction
in the moves of the different figures; and as Cavalry
can move more rapidly than Infantry, it has power to
move three squares, while the Infantry of the Line
moves but two.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will be said by some that the Cavalry has
the advantage of the Infantry; but on placing a piece
of Cavalry and a piece of Infantry on the board, by cautious
playing, it will be found almost impossible to capture
the Infantry with the single piece of Cavalry.</p>

<p>In the field, a regiment of Infantry, attacked by a
regiment of Cavalry, might easily escape altogether, or
may repulse and capture the regiment of Cavalry. The
reverse may happen, and the Cavalry, well handled,
may defeat and capture the regiment of Infantry.</p>

<p>The Light Infantry moves one, two, or three squares,
directly forward, right or left obliquely, and one or two
squares in any other direction. The object of this is,
chiefly, that there shall be a distinguishing power between
it and the Infantry of the Line.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>Light Infantry in the field does, or should, have the
advantage in moving more rapidly; besides, it often has
arms of a longer range, and can be used more successfully
when a sudden and rapid movement is necessary.</p>

<p>The Artillery moves diagonally, and has a range of
three squares on the diagonals. It cannot move perpendicularly
or laterally, therefore has no power in
those directions.</p>

<p>The Artillery can attain any position on the board,
but cannot always reach it directly, as does the Infantry
and Cavalry, but, in many instances, must make a
detour to the right or left.</p>

<p>This distinguishing move is proper, inasmuch as a
carriage cannot always follow the course of a man or
horse, yet it may reach any point that they can in a
country such as is represented by the board.</p>

<p>&#8220;Infantry or Cavalry cannot move in range of Artillery
of the opposing side, except when protected by Artillery
of their side,&#8221; etc. Artillery in the field may occupy
a position, several approaches to which it may so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
thoroughly command that it would be impracticable for
Infantry or Cavalry to take it, unassisted by Artillery,
by either of those approaches. Artillery would have to
be brought up in order to operate on the first-named
Artillery, or some other line of attack must be sought.</p>

<p>In the game, when one piece of Artillery <i>is not</i> protected
by another, there are four other points at which
it may be assailed, namely, the angles of the square.
But when one piece of Artillery is supported by another,
neither can be taken by Cavalry or Infantry without
the aid of their Artillery.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>If a battery in the field occupied a position commanding
thoroughly all of the approaches to it, and another
battery of the same side was placed a short distance behind
it, say in easy range, and commanded the first battery,
it would be very difficult for Cavalry or Infantry
to take the first-mentioned battery; and if they succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
in taking it, they could not easily, if at all, hold
it while under the fire of the supporting battery.</p>

<p>It may appear that the Artillery in the game has too
much power; but it must be remembered that a piece
of Artillery of one side can always take a piece of Artillery
of the other side that is placed in its range.</p>

<p>It often occurs in the field that one battery is brought
up close under the fire of another, to dislodge it; and if
both are well served, one must soon give way. See
Plate 4, Figure 1.</p>

<p>The Wagon,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> representing the Supply Train, moves
diagonally, like the Artillery, but only one or two
squares at a time; for it should not move so rapidly,
therefore it does not move so far.</p>

<p>The player should be careful to guard the Wagon,
for if it is captured he loses the game.</p>

<p>An invading army entering a country where supplies
cannot be procured, must necessarily carry them with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
him; and should his train be captured, with a good
army in his front, he would be in great danger of destruction.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">SUGGESTIONS TO PLAYERS.</h2>
</div>


<p>The attacking party should first determine upon a
plan of attack. Then proceed to arrange his figures in
proper order for the accomplishment of his plan. He
should guard his lines, by throwing forward Light Infantry
and Cavalry; but will endeavor to avoid an engagement
until his order of attack is formed.</p>

<p>Unless to secure a very decided advantage, when
once put in operation his first plan should not be abandoned.
The time lost in arranging a new plan may
be taken advantage of by the defending party, who
might assume the offensive and win the game.</p>

<p>The defending party, at the opening of the game,
should throw forward Light Infantry and Cavalry, to
guard against any rapid movement to take the Citadel,
that may be attempted by the attacking party with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Cavalry and Light Infantry. This will also give him
time and space for moving up and arranging his figures
in proper order for defence.</p>

<p>In advancing the Cavalry and Light Infantry, great
caution should be observed in placing the figures on the
squares most desirable for checking the advance of the
attacking party, while at the same time they are not
endangered.</p>

<p>No figure should be lost, if it can be avoided, at this
stage of the game; and no figure of the attacking party,
except Artillery, should be taken at the risk of the loss
of one of the defending party. Indeed, the defending
side should continue to remain strictly on the defence
till a good opportunity is offered for an attack; as, for instance,
when the figures of the attacking party are scattered,
and not in supporting distance of each other.</p>

<p>It is, however, best not to cross the river until the
attacking side is weakened by a considerable loss.</p>

<p>Early in the game, an opportunity is seldom offered
by a good player, where it is safe for the defending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
party to cross the river with a single figure; and it is
only when the attacking party has been weakened by
the loss of three or four figures, that two or three figures
can be spared from the defence.</p>

<p>When such advance is determined upon, be always
careful to leave the Citadel as securely guarded as possible.</p>

<p>If the attacking party be an expert player, he will
avoid an engagement until he has arranged his figures
in order for a grand attack.</p>

<p>If it is discovered that he is thus engaged, every good
opportunity to annoy him, and prevent the formation
of his plan, should be taken advantage of by man&#339;uvres,
feints, and sometimes real attacks, particularly at
his Artillery: and his Artillery should be taken, if possible,
even if it involve the loss of one or two figures of
the defending party; for by the loss of one piece of his
Artillery he will be more crippled than by the loss of
almost any two other figures.</p>

<p>The game requires the constant attention of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
players. Often the slightest mistake leads to defeat;
therefore be careful that every move is for a purpose.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">Explanation to Plate 1.</h2>
</div>


<p>The board has one hundred and thirty-nine (139) squares that can be occupied.
It represents a comparatively level field, traversed by a river impassable
except at the fords and bridge.</p>

<p>In crossing the fords and bridge the figures move one, two, or three squares,
according to their power, as elsewhere on the board. The short black lines indicate
the entrances to the fords and bridge.</p>

<p>A figure cannot take, or check, another across the river, except at the fords
and bridge. For example, a figure on square 39 cannot take, or check, a figure
on square 54; nor can a figure on square 55 take, or check, a figure on square
40 or 48. (Squares are numbered in Plate 4.)</p>


<p class="center">ARRANGEMENT OF THE FIGURES ON COMMENCING THE GAME.</p>

<p>On the defending side, Cavalry occupies the first square on the right of the
line of nine squares. Artillery, the second. Infantry of the Line, third, fourth,
and fifth. Cavalry, sixth. Artillery, seventh. Infantry of the Line, eighth
and ninth. The Citadel, fifth square from the right of the first line of eight
squares. Light Infantry, first, third, fifth, and seventh squares of the second
row of seven squares.</p>

<p>The figures of the attacking side are arranged like those of the defence, except
that the Wagon is placed on the fifth square of the line of nine squares,
and a piece of Infantry of the Line on the first square immediately in front
of it.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">Explanation to Plate 2.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Figure 1.</span>&mdash;When two pieces of Artillery, of opposite sides, are thus placed,
no figure, except Artillery, can occupy the squares one or two. If Artillery is
placed on either square, it can be taken by the Artillery of the other side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;The figure on square nine cannot now move on square seven, because
&#8220;a figure cannot occupy the second or third square from its Artillery, if
that square is in range of the Artillery of the other side.&#8221; But if the figure on
square eight moves to square six, then the figure on square nine could occupy
square seven, for that square will not then be covered by the Artillery on
square five.</p>

<p>Should the figure on square eight be placed on square four, then the Artillery
on squares three and five do not protect each other; and in that case the
Cavalry on square ten could take either of them: or the figure on square nine
could take the Artillery on square five, and if it were taken by the figure that
was on square eight, now on square four, then the Artillery on square three
could be taken by the Cavalry on square ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 3.</span>&mdash;In this case, if the Artillery on square fourteen is moved to
square fifteen, then the figures on squares sixteen and seventeen would be in
range of that piece, and must move (one at a time, of course); or after one is
moved, the Artillery on square eighteen may be brought up on the next square
to the remaining figure. For example, if the figure on square sixteen be
moved out of range, then the Artillery on square eighteen could be moved to
square nineteen, to the support of the figure on square seventeen. If either of
the squares sixteen or seventeen should be occupied by Artillery, of course that
figure could take the Artillery moved to square fifteen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 4.</span>&mdash;White figures representing the attacking party, and the black
figures the defending party.</p>

<p>The attacking party having the move, suppose the figure of Cavalry on
square twenty is moved to square twenty-one or twenty-two, then the Artillery
on square twenty-five is in danger of capture when the attacking party has another
move. Now the Artillery on square twenty-five cannot move, leaving
the figure on square twenty-four in range of the Artillery on square twenty-three.
If the player desires to save his Artillery on square twenty-five, he
might move the figure or square twenty-four to square twenty-six, in order to
protect his Artillery from capture by the Cavalry moved to twenty-one or
twenty-two; and if that piece were taken by the Cavalry, he would then have
an opportunity to move his Artillery away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 1.</span>&mdash;Shows how the Wagon may be taken.</p>

<p>Suppose the attacking party, having been repulsed with considerable loss, is
driven back from the river, pursued by the defending party, and the figures of
the two sides occupy the squares indicated in this plate&mdash;the white figures
representing the invading army, and the black figures the defending army.</p>

<p>The defending party having the move, suppose the Artillery on square fourteen
is moved to square thirteen. Then the Cavalry on square eight must
move, as &#8220;no figure, except Artillery, can occupy the first square next to the
Artillery of its side, if it is also the first square next to the Artillery of the
other side.&#8221; If the Cavalry on square eight is moved to square four, then the
Artillery now on square thirteen can take the Artillery on square five, and
could be taken by the Cavalry moved to square four, or the Infantry on square
six, or the Artillery on square two. Suppose it (the Artillery of defending side
having taken the Artillery on square five) is taken by the Cavalry now occupying
square four; then the Cavalry on square eleven could take the Artillery on
square two, and if it (the Cavalry of defending side, moved to square two) is
taken by the Cavalry of attacking party now on square five, or the Infantry on
square six, then the Infantry of defending party, on square seven, could take
the Wagon on square one.</p>

<p>There are many other combinations for the capture of the Wagon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;Shows how the Citadel may be taken.</p>

<p>Light Infantry, Infantry of the Line, or Cavalry of the attacking side, can
take the Citadel when it is within their range, if no figure intervenes. For example,
if the Artillery of the defending side is placed as indicated in this
figure (on squares eight and ten), a figure of Cavalry or Light Infantry of the
attacking party, on square one, or a figure of Cavalry, Infantry of the Line, or
Light Infantry, being on square two, three, four, six, or seven, or a figure of
Cavalry on square five, could take the Citadel, if the attacking side had the
move. But suppose the defending party had the move, and a figure of Cavalry
or Infantry occupied square one or two, and either piece of Artillery was
placed on square nine; then the figure on square one or two could not take the
Citadel, but must move out of range of the Artillery. If the Artillery on
square ten is moved to square nine, then the figure of the attacking side on
square two could occupy square three, and the next move could take the Citadel;
or if the Artillery on square eight were moved to square nine, then the figure
on square two could move to square seven, and on its next move could take the
Citadel; for though the Citadel would be in range of the Artillery on square
nine, that would not prevent its capture. A city may be very well defended
on one side, and yet might be easily taken at another point.</p>

<p>Of course, the Cavalry and Infantry should co-operate with the Artillery in
defending the Citadel; and the player should endeavor to prevent the attacking
party from occupying any square from which it could be taken.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Explanation to Plate 4.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Figure 1.</span>&mdash;If the Artillery on square 21 is moved to square 22, the Artillery
on square 26 can take it, or move out of range. If the Artillery on square 26
takes the Artillery moved to square 22, then it could be taken by the Cavalry
on square 20, or the Artillery on square 23. If it, on the other hand, moves to
square 27, it could be taken by the Artillery on square 23; and if it is moved
to square 24, 25, or 31, it could be taken by the figure on square 30. But if it
is not moved at all, then the Artillery moved to square 22 could take it its next
move.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 2.</span>&mdash;Shows how the figures of the game can be moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cavalry can be moved one, two, or three squares, in any direction, at the
discretion of the player,&#8221; provided the way is not obstructed by another figure.
For instance, the Cavalry on square 15 could not be moved to square 12,
because the figure on square 13 intervenes. Nor, if the cavalry is moved to
square 37, could it afterwards be moved to square 35 or 34, while a figure occupied
square 36. If the Cavalry on square 15 is moved to square 37, it could
afterwards be moved to square 29, 21, or 12, or to 22 or 6, or to 30, 23, or 15, or
to 38, or to 45 or 53, or to 52, 65, or 76, or to 44, 51, or 57, etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;Light Infantry moves one, two, or three squares, directly forward, right
or left obliquely, and one or two squares in any other direction, at the discretion
of the player.&#8221; Now, if a piece of Light Infantry occupies square 36, it
could be moved directly forward to square 51, 64, or 75; left obliquely to square
43, 50, or 56; right obliquely, to square 44, 52, or 59; to the left, to square 35
or 34; obliquely to the left and rear, to square 28 or 20; to the rear, to square
21 or 5; obliquely to the right and rear, to square 29 or 22; and to the right,
to square 37 or 38.</p>

<p>&#8220;Infantry of the Line moves one or two squares, at the discretion of the
player, in any direction.&#8221; If a piece of Infantry of the Line were on square 13, it
could be moved either to square 29, 44, 21, 28, 12, 5, 6, 14, 22, or 30, etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;Artillery moves diagonally, one, two, or three squares at a time, at the
discretion of the player.&#8221; A figure of Artillery being on square 9, could be
moved to square 1, 2, 17, 24, 31, 18, 26, or 34. If it were moved to square 31, it
could then be moved to square 39, 47, or 55, or back to 24, 17, or 9, etc. If a
piece of Artillery occupied square 51, no figure of the opposite party, except
Artillery, could be placed on square 58, 65, 73, 57, 63, 70, 43, 35, 27, 44, 37, or
30, unless that square were next to the Artillery of the other side. See rules of
the game relative to Artillery, page 6.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Wagon can be moved one or two squares at a time, at the discretion of
the player.&#8221; The Wagon being on square 11, could be moved to square 3, 4,
20, 28, 19, or 26, etc.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
